As part of the coruse digital audio and speech processing, students carry out a compulsary project. The requirements on this year's project are given below:
•Project is compulsory and carried out in groups of 2-3 students
•Evaluation is done during the exam (hand in report)
Project:
•Design and build a single-channel speech enhancement system with hearing aid functionality
•Use matlab/simulink
•The speech enhancement system should consist of a gain function, noise PSD estimator and speech PSD estimator.
•Using a hearing loss profile, the hearing aid functionality should be able to carry out a frequency dependent gain and compression.
•Perform an evaluation of the speech enhancement system
Bonus:
•Make the system work real-time (use simulink functions)
•The system uses the built-in microphone of the laptop (use the provided simulink functionality)
